> The word theatre comes from the Greeks. It means the seeing place. It is the place people come to see the truth about life and the social situation. The theatre is a spiritual and social X-ray of its time. The theatre was created to tell people the truth about life and the social situation. ~Stella Adler 

<br>

"You should feel a flow of joy because you are alive. Your body will feel full of life. That is what you must give from the stage. Your life. No less. That is art: to give all you have." - Anton Chekhov<br><br>
"I think the theatre is as essential to civilization as safe, pure water." -Vanessa Redgrave
<br>
<br>
"From the start it has been the theatre's business to entertain people ... it needs no other passport than fun." -Bertolt Brecht
<br><br>
"All the worldâ€™s a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts."
~William Shakespeare
