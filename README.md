# Theater Friends

> "I think the theatre is as essential to civilization as safe, pure water." -Vanessa Redgrave 

<br>
My concept for this app was to provide a place where actors, and friends of actors, could provide (and access) information on their upcoming shows, without other distractions or missed connections. One post, and everyone will have all the latest show information at their fingertips, so the actor can then focus on what they need to focus on: preparing for their upcoming productions. 

<br>
<br>
As an actress and someone with many friends in the theater world, I have regretted missing friends' shows, and it happens more frequently than I like. Having somewhere I can keep up with who has an upcoming show seems like a dream come true. No facebook notifications or feed to distract me from event information, and even if they forgot to let everyone know, a quick pop-in on this app means I've got all the info I need to support my community.
